One might say this is *the* hardest aspect of living off campus and trust us, we understand. But from one Hokie to another, we are here to help make all of that a little easier, with some advice from professionals (aka upperclassmen).


Here is an [Off-Campus Housing Guide](https://www.globaleducation.vt.edu/content/dam/globaleducation_vt_edu/documents/Off-Campus%20Housing%20Guide.pdf) created by Virginia Tech.
### When to Tour? Do I Tour?
We recommend that you begin touring different apartment complexes towards the end of fall semester, before Winter Break. Now you've given yourself ample amount of time to consider multiple locations and discuss with your roommates to find the best fit for everyone. 

You can tour apartments for free! Most of the time, you just need to call, and their office will be helpful in scheduling you (and whoever) for a tour.

### Location
As a senior, your main priorities are living near downtown and Center St., but as a sophomore, that is not necessarily the case. Most people have the mindset of "save your money and live in a nice place" sophomore and junior year and when you are a senior, find that apartment in the ideal location so that you can truly make the most of your senior year. 

Most apartment complexes sit on the opposite side of Prices Fork Rd, parallel from campus. As an underclassman, this where we recommend living. There are many bus routes in the area, and it is close to a local Kroger and Food Lion. 

!!! info
    Typically, the further away from campus you are, the less expensive it will be. This is not a deciding factor for most but it is good to keep in mind during your search.

 
### Furnished or Unfurnished?
There are pros and cons to living in furnished and unfurnished apartments. 

Furnished apartments cost significantly more, but you can save yourself the hassle of searching for, buying, and moving furniture. Moving costs could be a factor, too, if you canâ€™t move the furniture yourself.

Unfurnished apartments cost less; this is a large pull. Although the idea of finding furniture might seem daunting, it is actually really easy. People are *always* selling on Facebook Marketplace for very affordable prices. Moving the furniture in and out is the most difficult aspect, though it can be more physically demanding than financially. Depends on if you are up for the extra work to save some money. And something else to keep in mind, when you graduate and possibly live on your own in the future, you will already have furniture, which is nice. 

### Joint vs. Separate Leases
A joint lease means that you and all your roommates are on the exact same lease. If one person were to sign it, and then over the summer, before move-in, decide that they are going to live somewhere else, the rest of you are going to be responsible for paying that. The roommate who left won't face any legal consequences, which is the drawback of a joint lease.

!!! info 
    Unless you *really* trust your roommates, choose a separate lease. That way, no matter what happens, the only persons slack you need to pick up financially is your own.


### Price Points
As the lease start date approaches, apartment prices will increase. This can create stress early on fall semester because your mindset is telling you to save money and book early, but it should not be too much of a stressor. The prices don't change drastically until February and March come around.
