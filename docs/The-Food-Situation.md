## The Food Situation
Living off campus can offer more flexibility when it comes to food, but it also requires knowing where to shop and how to manage the Virginia Tech meal plans. 
### Blacksburg Grocery Stores
Blacksburg and Christiansburg offer several groceries stores, with key factors to consider when selecting a store including location, price, and convenience.

**1. Food Lion**

Blacksburg has two Food Lion locations:  one Food Lion near the Hunter’s Ridge apartments and another Food Lion near Foxridge Apartments. Food Lion is known for being an affordable grocery store chain.  
    
**2. Kroger**

Blacksburg has two Kroger locations: a Kroger near downtown Blacksburg and another Kroger close to The Edge Apartments. The Kroger close to downtown is often considered the nicer of the two.      
**3. Local Markets and Farmers Market**

Blacksburg has several local markets, including a weekly Farmers Market in Downtown. The Farmers Market hours vary by season, typically operating two days a week, for four to six hours. While these markets offer fresh, local produce, prices are generally higher than those at nationwide grocery chains.

**4. Oasis Market**

International food cuisine, located across from the S. Main St. Kroger. This store provides a wide variety of international foods, such as Asian, Mediterranean, and African cuisine. 
    
**5. Walmart**

Christiansburg has a Walmart, known for its low prices and wide selection of groceries, clothing, and household items. While not located in Blacksburg, the TTT bus provides direct service to Walmart
    
**6. Aldi** 

Located in Christiansburg, Aldi is one of the most affordable grocery store chains nationwide. Unlike Walmart, there is no direct bus service to Aldi. Over 90% of Aldi's products are store-brand, compared to other stores that carry national brands. 
###  Grocery Transportation
As an off-campus student, getting around town to access groceries, dining, and other amenities is essential. Fortunately, Blacksburg and Virginia Tech offer several transportation options for students:

**1. [Blacksburg Transit](https://ridebt.org/)**

Using the Blacksburg Transit App or a map app, several bus routes provide direct access to grocery stores. The *TTT* route goes to Walmart, *UCB* stops near the University City Blvd. Kroger, and *PHB* stops close to the North Main St. Food Lion. For routes that don’t directly serve grocery stores, transportation apps can help plan combined bus and walking routes.

**2. Walking/Biking/Electronic Scooters**

Depending on your location, some grocery stores might be within walking distance. If you own or are planning on owning a bike or electronic scooter, using them are options for transportation.

**3. Uber/Lyft**

If you don't have a car available to you, both Ubers and Lyfts are available to take you to nearby grocery stores. This option costs money, unlike the buses or walking.
### Dining Flex Plan versus Dining Dollars versus Commuter Cash

Students living off-campus have a few different options if they would like to eat from the dining halls on campus.

!!! info 
    Dining plans are not mandatory if you are an off-campus student; however, if you don't enjoy cooking or are on campus during meal times frequently, meal plans are worth considering. 

**1. Dining Flex Plans**

Listed below are the dining flex plans that Virginia Tech offers. The Minor Flex Plan is only available for off-campus students, but off-campus students can purchase any size flex plan. Flex Plans get a 67 percent discount at D2, an all-you-care-to-eat venue in Dietrick Hall, and 50 percent off the cash price at all other venues. However, for all Flex Plans, you pay the school extra money that will not end up in your Dining Dollars. Funds from flex plans will roll over from fall semester to spring semester, but **will not** roll over from year to year.

| FLEX PLANS FALL 2024 | PRICE PER SEMESTER | FLEX DOLLARS |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Minor Flex Plan    | $1,486     | $594     |
| Major Flex Plan     | $2,796.50     | $1,012     |
| Mega Flex Plan    | $2,999.50   | $1,215     |
| Premium Flex Plan    | $3,209.50     | $1,425    |

**2. Dining Dollars**

Dining dollars work like a debit card. Instead of purchasing a plan and having the cash put on your Hokie Passport, you deposit cash directly in yourself. Purchases made with Dining Dollars come with a 5% discount. Deposits can be made in increments of $15 to $1,400 and **remain** on your account for as long as you’re a student at Virginia Tech.

**3. Commuter Cash**

For students living off-campus, the Commuter Cash dining plan costs $486 per semester and allows for tax-free purchases at our venues. Unlike the Flex dining plans and Dining Dollars, Commuter Cash doesn't include discounted purchases. To supplement the plan, deposits can also be made in the form of Dining Dollars and receive 5 percent off the cash price for all purchases. Commuter cash will roll over from fall to spring, but **will not** roll over from year to year.
