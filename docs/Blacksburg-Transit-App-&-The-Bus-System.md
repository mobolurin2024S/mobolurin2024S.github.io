## Blacksburg Transit App & The Bus System

### What is Blacksburg Transit?

Each bus displays its route (in shorthand) at the front and back of the bus.

### What To Do When The BT App Breaks
As stated earlier, the BT app frequently breaks down. When the app inevitably breaks you want do the following:

-  Check out the "Alerts" section on the app. Sometimes, what looks like the app breaking might have already been addressed through a public notice. There might be instructions for an official temporary solution provided by BT.
-  Make sure to familiarize yourself with [BT's website](https://ridebt.org/). When the app fails, the website should be your next point of reference.
-  <u>**Ensure**</u> that you have a backup transportation app installed. Popular backup options are [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) and [Transit](https://transitapp.com/).
