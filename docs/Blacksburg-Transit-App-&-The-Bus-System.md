## Blacksburg Transit App & The Bus System

### What is Blacksburg Transit?
Blacksburg Transit is the public bus system that goes around the town, parts of Christiansburg, and Roanoke. Blacksburg Transit is free to all Virginia Tech Students and Blacksburg residents. 

Each bus displays its route (in shorthand) at the front and back of the bus.

### Blacksburg Transit App
This is the official app for Blacksburg Transit. It includes all of the routes in Blacksburg and one route in Christiansburg.

### Tips for Using the Bus System
Riding the bus for the first time may be confusing, especially if you have minimal experience with public transit. A yellow cord runs along the sides of the bus. When you ride, pull down on the yellow cord before your stop to indicate to the bus driver that you want to get off. Even if the bus stops to pick up people at your desired stop, if no one pulled the yellow cord, the exit doors may not open. 

If you ride a bicycle and need to take the bus, don't worry! Each bus has a bicycle rack out on the front of the bus. The bus driver can help you lower the rack to secure your bike. You may need to let the bus driver know as you exit that you have a bike to dismount. In this case, exit through the front of the bus instead of the side exit doors.

All buses (excluding the Explorer buses in Christiansburg) stop at Virginia Tech at some point. Most buses dock at the Maroon and Orange loops, which you can view on the app. When the buses stop here, they "time check" which means they will stay at the bus loop until their exact departure time. With all other stops, the bus may be arrive early or late and pass by stops if no one is getting off and no one is standing nearby to get on. Arriving on time avoids the frustration of missing your ride.

The bus schedules are consistent throughout the year except for holidays, football games, and road issues. The buses repeat around every **15 minutes** during the week and **30 minutes** over the weekend.

### What To Do When The BT App Breaks
As stated earlier, the BT app frequently breaks down. When the app inevitably breaks you want do the following:

-  Check out the "Alerts" section on the app. Sometimes, what looks like the app breaking might have already been addressed through a public notice. There might be instructions for an official temporary solution provided by BT.
-  Make sure to familiarize yourself with [BT's website](https://ridebt.org/). When the app fails, the website should be your next point of reference.
-  <u>**Ensure**</u> that you have a backup transportation app installed. Popular backup options are [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) and [Transit](https://transitapp.com/).
