## Blacksburg Transit App & The Bus System

### What is Blacksburg Transit?
Blacksburg Transit is the public bus system that goes around the town, parts of Christiansburg, and Roanoke. Blacksburg Transit is free to all Virginia Tech Students and Blacksburg residents. 

Each bus displays its route (in shorthand) at the front and back of the bus.

### Blacksburg Transit App
This is the official app for Blacksburg Transit. It includes all of the routes in Blacksburg and one route in Christiansburg.

### What To Do When The BT App Breaks
As stated earlier in the guide, the BT app frequently breaks down. To avoid being stranded, you want to make sure you have back up plans in mind every time you step out.

If you every find yourself stranded and the app doesn't seem to be working, try checking out the "Alerts" section on the app. Sometimes, what looks like the app breaking might have already been addressed through a BT public notice. BT might have already issued instructions for an official temporary solution.

If there doesn't seem to be be any new alerts or the app keeps crashing, try checking out [BT's website](https://ridebt.org/). When the app fails, the website should immediately come to mind as your next point of reference. 

!!! Note
    If the website is also down and all else fails trying calling the BT number: [540-443-1500] (M-F 8 a.m. - 5 p.m.)

Sometimes the best solution is simply prevention. Ensure that you have a backup transportation app installed. The second one fails, you can switch to the other. Popular backup options are [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) and [Transit](https://transitapp.com/), but remember each have pros and cons as stated earlier in this guide.
