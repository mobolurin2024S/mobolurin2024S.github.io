## Blacksburg Transit App & The Bus System

### What is Blacksburg Transit?
Blacksburg Transit is the public bus system that goes around the town, parts of Christiansburg, and Roanoke. It is free to all Virginia Tech Students and Blacksburg residents. 

Each bus displays its route (in shorthand) at the front and back of the bus.


### Blacksburg Transit App
This is the official app for Blacksburg Transit. It includes all of the routes in Blacksburg and one route in Christiansburg.
- [Blacksburg Transit App](https://www.ridebt.org/bt-app)
    - PROS: live bus tracking, shows adjusted routes
    - CONS: app frequently breaks down, unintuitive trip planning function
- [Blacksburg Transit Website](https://ridebt.org/)
    - PROS: live bus tracking, updates bus capacity,   mentions detours/changes in routes, all transit information, can file a lost and found claim
    - CONS: harder to navigate on phones, the live bus map breaks the same as the app

### Alternatives to Blacksburg Transit

### Tips for Using the Bus System
- Buses may not stop unless requested. To request for the bus to stop, gently tug on a yellow cable on the sides of the bus. 
- Bicycle racks are available at the front of every bus
- All buses stop at Virginia Tech at some point. Especially at Maroon/Orange Bus Loops
- Buses repeat every **15 minutes** during the week and about **30 minutes** over the weekend

### Bus Hours
| Day of the Week | Regular Hours | Reduced Service Hours |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Monday ---- Thursday     | 7am - 12:45am     | 7am - 9:45pm     |
| Friday     | 7am - 2:45am     | 7am - 9:45pm     |

| Sunday     | 9:30am - 10:45pm     | 9:30am - 9:45pm     |

### What To Do When The BT App Breaks
As stated earlier, the BT app frequently breaks down. When the app inevitably breaks you want do the following:

-  Check out the "Alerts" section on the app. Sometimes, what looks like the app breaking might have already been addressed through a public notice. There might be instructions for an official temporary solution provided by BT.
-  Make sure to familiarize yourself with [BT's website](https://ridebt.org/). When the app fails, the website should be your next point of reference.
-  <u>**Ensure**</u> that you have a backup transportation app installed. Popular backup options are [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) and [Transit](https://transitapp.com/).

## Apartment Hunting
![an image of Downtown Blacksburg](https://lci.vt.edu/content/lci_vt_edu/en/handbook/housing-and-food/_jcr_content/article-image.transform/m-medium/image.jpg)

One might say this is *the* hardest aspect of living off campus and trust us, we understand. But from one Hokie to another, we are here to help make all of that a little easier, with some advice from professionals (aka upperclassmen).


Here is an [Off-Campus Housing Guide](https://www.globaleducation.vt.edu/content/dam/globaleducation_vt_edu/documents/Off-Campus%20Housing%20Guide.pdf) created by Virginia Tech.
### When to Tour? Do I Tour?
We recommend that you begin touring different apartment complexes towards the end of fall semester, before Winter Break. Now you've given yourself ample amount of time to consider multiple locations and discuss with your roommates to find the best fit for everyone. 

You can tour apartments for free! Most of the time, you just need to call, and their office will be helpful in scheduling you (and whoever) for a tour.

### Location
As a senior, your main priorities are living near downtown and Center St., but as a sophomore, that is not necessarily the case. Most people have the mindset of "save your money and live in a nice place" sophomore and junior year and when you are a senior, find that apartment in the ideal location so that you can truly make the most of your senior year. 

Most apartment complexes sit on the opposite side of Prices Fork Rd, parallel from campus. As an underclassman, this where we recommend living. There are many bus routes in the area, and it is close to a local Kroger and Food Lion. 

:::info
Typically, the further away from campus you are, the less expensive it will be. This is not a deciding factor for most but it is good to keep in mind during your search.
:::
 
### Furnished or Unfurnished?
There are pros and cons to living in furnished and unfurnished apartments. 

Furnished apartments cost significantly more, but you can save yourself the hassle of searching for, buying, and moving furniture. Moving costs could be a factor, too, if you can’t move the furniture yourself.

Unfurnished apartments cost less; this is a large pull. Although the idea of finding furniture might seem daunting, it is actually really easy. People are *always* selling on Facebook Marketplace for very affordable prices. Moving the furniture in and out is the most difficult aspect, though it can be more physically demanding than financially. Depends on if you are up for the extra work to save some money. And something else to keep in mind, when you graduate and possibly live on your own in the future, you will already have furniture, which is nice. 

### Joint vs. Separate Leases
A joint lease means that you and all your roommates are on the exact same lease. If one person were to sign it, and then over the summer, before move-in, decide that they are going to live somewhere else, the rest of you are going to be responsible for paying that. The roommate who left won't face any legal consequences, which is the drawback of a joint lease.

:::info 
Unless you *really* trust your roommates, choose a separate lease. That way, no matter what happens, the only persons slack you need to pick up financially is your own.
:::

### Price Points
As the lease start date approaches, apartment prices will increase. This can create stress early on fall semester because your mindset is telling you to save money and book early, but it should not be too much of a stressor. The prices don't change drastically until February and March come around.

## The Food Situation
Living off campus can offer more flexibility when it comes to food, but it also requires knowing where to shop and how to manage the Virginia Tech meal plans. 
### Blacksburg Grocery Stores
Blacksburg and Christiansburg offer several groceries stores, with key factors to consider when selecting a store including location, price, and convenience.

**1. Food Lion**

Blacksburg has two Food Lion locations:  one Food Lion near the Hunter’s Ridge apartments and another Food Lion near Foxridge Apartments. Food Lion is known for being an affordable grocery store chain.  
    
**2. Kroger**

Blacksburg has two Kroger locations: a Kroger near downtown Blacksburg and another Kroger close to The Edge Apartments. The Kroger close to downtown is often considered the nicer of the two.      
**3. Local Markets and Farmers Market**

Blacksburg has several local markets, including a weekly Farmers Market in Downtown. The Farmers Market hours vary by season, typically operating two days a week, for four to six hours. While these markets offer fresh, local produce, prices are generally higher than those at nationwide grocery chains.

**4. Oasis Market**

International food cuisine, located across from the S. Main St. Kroger. This store provides a wide variety of international foods, such as Asian, Mediterranean, and African cuisine. 
    
**5. Walmart**

Christiansburg has a Walmart, known for its low prices and wide selection of groceries, clothing, and household items. While not located in Blacksburg, the TTT bus provides direct service to Walmart
    
**6. Aldi** 

Located in Christiansburg, Aldi is one of the most affordable grocery store chains nationwide. Unlike Walmart, there is no direct bus service to Aldi. Over 90% of Aldi's products are store-brand, compared to other stores that carry national brands. 
###  Grocery Transportation
As an off-campus student, getting around town to access groceries, dining, and other amenities is essential. Fortunately, Blacksburg and Virginia Tech offer several transportation options for students:

**1. [Blacksburg Transit](https://ridebt.org/)**

Using the Blacksburg Transit App or a map app, several bus routes provide direct access to grocery stores. The *TTT* route goes to Walmart, *UCB* stops near the University City Blvd. Kroger, and *PHB* stops close to the North Main St. Food Lion. For routes that don’t directly serve grocery stores, transportation apps can help plan combined bus and walking routes.

**2. Walking/Biking/Electronic Scooters**

Depending on your location, some grocery stores might be within walking distance. If you own or are planning on owning a bike or electronic scooter, using them are options for transportation.

**3. Uber/Lyft**

If you don't have a car available to you, both Ubers and Lyfts are available to take you to nearby grocery stores. This option costs money, unlike the buses or walking.
### Dining Flex Plan versus Dining Dollars versus Commuter Cash
![Picture of Students Eating at a Virginia Tech Dining Hall](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByQv9nGAyx.jpg)

Students living off-campus have a few different options if they would like to eat from the dining halls on campus.
:::info 
Dining plans are not mandatory if you are an off-campus student; however, if you don't enjoy cooking or are on campus during meal times frequently, meal plans are worth considering.  :::

**1. Dining Flex Plans**

Listed below are the dining flex plans that Virginia Tech offers. The Minor Flex Plan is only available for off-campus students, but off-campus students can purchase any size flex plan. Flex Plans get a 67 percent discount at D2, an all-you-care-to-eat venue in Dietrick Hall, and 50 percent off the cash price at all other venues. However, for all Flex Plans, you pay the school extra money that will not end up in your Dining Dollars. Funds from flex plans will roll over from fall semester to spring semester, but **will not** roll over from year to year.

| FLEX PLANS FALL 2024 | PRICE PER SEMESTER | FLEX DOLLARS |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Minor Flex Plan    | $1,486     | $594     |
| Major Flex Plan     | $2,796.50     | $1,012     |
| Mega Flex Plan    | $2,999.50   | $1,215     |
| Premium Flex Plan    | $3,209.50     | $1,425    |

**2. Dining Dollars**

Dining dollars work like a debit card. Instead of purchasing a plan and having the cash put on your Hokie Passport, you deposit cash directly in yourself. Purchases made with Dining Dollars come with a 5% discount. Deposits can be made in increments of $15 to $1,400 and **remain** on your account for as long as you’re a student at Virginia Tech.

**3. Commuter Cash**

For students living off-campus, the Commuter Cash dining plan costs $486 per semester and allows for tax-free purchases at our venues. Unlike the Flex dining plans and Dining Dollars, Commuter Cash doesn't include discounted purchases. To supplement the plan, deposits can also be made in the form of Dining Dollars and receive 5 percent off the cash price for all purchases. Commuter cash will roll over from fall to spring, but **will not** roll over from year to year.
