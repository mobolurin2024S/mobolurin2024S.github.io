# Living Off Campus

Independent living can be a daunting task to navigate on your own. Adjusting to a new scenery, planning grocery routes, and finding a place to live might feel like a lot to handle all at once.

Maybe you're a freshman moving off-campus next semester, or perhaps it's your first time living in Blacksburg. You don't have to go on this journey alone.

This guide will provide a general overview about the main things to consider when living off-campus in Blacksburg. We will be going over the Blacksburg bus and transportation system, apartment hunting, and grocery shopping.
