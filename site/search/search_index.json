Moving costs could be a factor, too, if you can\u2019t move the furniture yourself.</p> <p>Unfurnished apartments cost less; this is a large pull. Although the idea of finding furniture might seem daunting, it is actually really easy. People are always selling on Facebook Marketplace for very affordable prices. Moving the furniture in and out is the most difficult aspect, though it can be more physically demanding than financially. Depends on if you are up for the extra work to save some money.

The roommate who left won't face any legal consequences, which is the drawback of a joint lease.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>Unless you really trust your roommates, choose a separate lease.

A yellow cord runs along the sides of the bus. When you ride, pull down on the yellow cord before your stop to indicate to the bus driver that you want to get off. Even if the bus stops to pick up people at your desired stop, if no one pulled the yellow cord, the exit doors may not open. </p> <p>Note</p> <p>If you ride a bicycle and need to take the bus, don't worry! Each bus has a bicycle rack out on the front of the bus. The bus driver can help you lower the rack to secure your bike. You may need to let the bus driver know as you exit that you have a bike to dismount. In this case, exit through the front of the bus instead of the side exit doors.</p> <p>All buses (excluding the Explorer buses in Christiansburg) stop at Virginia Tech at some point. Most buses dock at the Maroon and Orange loops, which you can view on the app. When the buses stop here, they \"time check\" which means they will stay at the bus loop until their exact departure time. With all other stops, the bus may be arrive early or late and pass by stops if no one is getting off and no one is standing nearby to get on. Arriving on time avoids the frustration of missing your ride.</p> <p>The bus schedules are consistent throughout the year except for holidays, football games, and road issues.

Dining Flex Plans</p> <p>Listed below are the dining flex plans that Virginia Tech offers. The Minor Flex Plan is only available for off-campus students, but off-campus students can purchase any size flex plan. Flex Plans get a 67 percent discount at D2, an all-you-care-to-eat venue in Dietrick Hall, and 50 percent off the cash price at all other venues.
